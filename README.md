# Amaizing_Box
In this project inside the box 'right button' key on a mouse will generate random movable points, pressing the “up arrow” key on the keyboard will increase the speed of all the points generated so far, and pressing the “down arrow” key on the keyboard will decrease the speed. Pressing the “Spacebar” on the keyboard should freeze all the points.
